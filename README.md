Accounting

A Symfony project created on July 26, 2017, 2:31 AM.

I just wanna spend 1 hour a day learning Symfony 3, from scratch.

## Starting the app

To just start it:

```
php bib/console server:start
```

To stop:

```
php bin/console server:stop
```

To start while watching:

```
php bin/console server:run
```

To stop watching, just press `CTRL+c`.
